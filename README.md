![Filling the lines with numbers that have values between the one above and the one below](/images/fig3.png) <br>
## Filling the matrix horizontally 
* The process above is repeated but horizontally
* New columns are created with numbers that have values in between the number to the left and to the right <br>
![Filling the matrix the same way but horizontally, the numbers have values between the number to the right and to the left](/images/fig4.png) <br>
## repeating the process 
* repeating the vertical and horizontal processes one more time <br>
